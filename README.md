# Workshop 2, INTELLIGENT FARMING ROBOT PROTOTYPE USING IoT APPLICATION

- sadly it's not a perfect system

- A robot with arm and camera that can auto plant and harvest crop. A farm used vertical farming method with the help of robot.

## Detail and Related Things

- ev3dev Debian, System Management Bus, Google Cloud Platform, Remote Python Call and Windows 10 as central place

- Lego Mindstorm EV3, TETRIX, HiTechnic, Phone Camera, Laptop for RPyC administration

- Visual Studio Code, OpenCV, Android IPWebCam, Google Cloud Vision API, Keras API Tensorflow

- Python

### Due to large size of project, I upload only core of the project.

- this repo is to backup and easily access of my things, and to open dicussion.

- grpcio, a library/package of python which fail to install in ev3 brick. So, I use RPyC to use laptop as the main brain/control center of machine instead of ev3 brick. More detail at "coding\report.txt"

- a simple demo "video and photo\VID_20181212_110411.mp4"
