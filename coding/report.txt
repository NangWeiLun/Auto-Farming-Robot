installing google-cloud-vision
pip2 or pip3 also meet problem while installing grpcio
it cause diconnect every time and ev3 hang sometime

normal install setting pip/pip2/pip3 install google-cloud-vision
	stop at downloading grpcio 99% then disconnect

with --no-cache-dir
	download grpcio complete but disconnect when install it

with --ignore-installed --no-dependencies --no-cache-dir
+ pip install --upgrade six
	progress until installing grpcio but disconnect without complete install


install on debian8 jessie the ev3dev stable version
for python2.7
	no problem at first but
	install the major package but then when install it download and install other package
	halfway it disconnect
	restart and install again same problem occur

for python3.4
	successful
	need to install pip, easy_install pip
		sudo easy_install3 pip
	grpc is installed local by default, it come with ev3dev for py3.4

init gcloud
	disconnect after choose y/n for create engine
	need to create compute engine to bypass check step
	
python2 is required to use from google.cloud import vision
	ImportError: cannot import name 'cygrpc'
	to use need to install pyasn1, rsa, cachetools, grpc (my estimation fail, it still need grpc, py2 cannot use)
		python2 -m pip install pyasn1_modules
		or
		follow rex method
		pip uninstall pyasn1
		python -m easy_install pyasn1-0.4.2-py2.7.egg

other
	pip install cancel when downloading ctrl+c will make ev3 disconnect
	change pip default
